# ASCII QUESTION
In that question, we can clearly observe that every alphabetical character are indeed integer numbers.
If we add a number to a memory location pointer, it will cause it to leap another element of an array. (But the size of data type is not concerned)

## Illustration

## Important Points to Notice
There we're providing a memory location and substition of a two ascii character is added to that character. For substitution with ASCII character, we substitute of their integer value.
After that point, we can clearly see that we have a new memory location.
Compiler sees a memory location as a startup point to scan an array, if you give it to __printf__ function as an argument.
